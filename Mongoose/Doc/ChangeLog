Version 3.0.0, Sept FIXME, 2022

    * integers: SuiteSparse_long (nominally 64-bit) replaced
        with int64_t.  This change should be backward compatible
        with v2.0.4, since the integer sizes (sizeof(...)) should remain the
        same.  However, since this is a possible change to the binary API,
        the version number becomes v3.0.0.
    * minor change to the build system

Version 2.0.4, May 25, 2019
