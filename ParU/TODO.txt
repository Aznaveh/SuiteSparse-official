FIXME is the Symbolic object read-only in numeric factorization? Yes.
    All uses of arrays should be:
    const intt64_t *stuff = Sym->stuff ;

FIXME make Numeric and Symbolic objects opaque? Yes.
    (add routines to give access to P, Q, scale factor Rs, n, rcond)
    Keep Control structures non-opaque.

FIXME MATLAB interface, add options and stats

FIXME for MATLAB, check if MKL BLAS is being used

FIXME test performance results again, for ACM TOMS paper
