FIXME is the Symbolic object read-only in numeric factorization?
    All uses of arrays should be:
    const intt64_t *stuff = Sym->stuff ;

FIXME make Numeric and Symbolic objects opaque?
    (add routines to give access to P, Q, scale factor Rs, n, rcond)
    Keep Control structures non-opaque.

FIXME MATLAB interface, add options and stats

FIXME test performance results again, for ACM TOMS paper

FIXME Tcov: missing parts of paru_tasked_dgemm
