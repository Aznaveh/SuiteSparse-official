FIXME test performance results again, for ACM TOMS paper
FIXME is Doc/Doxyfile needed?

FIXME: what should the default ordering be?  What if it is invalid?
    In v0.1, if the ordering parameter was out of bounds, it was set to AMD
    (not the default).  The default was METIS in the ParU.h definitions for the
    Control struct.  Should the default be METIS_GUARD? or AMD?  METIS_GUARD is
    better than METIS.
